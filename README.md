# My resources
Collection of personal resources, either created by me or by others, that I use across various coding and design projects.

## More Info
Some of these resources I created, and others are borrowed, adapted, or referenced.
I will do my absolute best to distinguish between the types, as well as give credit and attribution wherever is appropriate.   


Some of these resources are code (sometimes full scripts or modules, etc., others are only snippets), some are images and design assets, others are simply guides or templates.
